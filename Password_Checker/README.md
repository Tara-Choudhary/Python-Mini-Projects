# Password Strength Checker

This project is a simple Python script (`password_checker.py`) that checks the strength of a userâ€™s password based on **length and character variety**.

It demonstrates the use of **strings, loops, and conditionals** in Python while applying real-world rules for password security.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Input a password from the user
- Check if password is at least **8 characters long**
- Detect presence of:
  - âœ… Numbers
  - âœ… Uppercase letters
  - âœ… Lowercase letters
  - âœ… Special characters (!@#$%^&\* etc.)
- Rates password as **Weak, Medium, or Strong**
- Beginner-friendly command-line interface

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Practiced using **loops and conditionals** for multiple rules
- Used **string methods** like `.isdigit()`, `.isupper()`, `.islower()`
- Learned how to **scan through each character in a string**
- Built logic that applies to **real-world scenarios (password security)**
